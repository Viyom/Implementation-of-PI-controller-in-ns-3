Assignment: #FP2   Implementation of PI controller in nsÂ­3

PI Controller[5] is an Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithm like RED[1], ARED[3], etc. PIE[4], the latest algorithm, is based on PI. PI Controller is already implemented in ns.2[2] This repository contains an implementation of PI controller in ns.3[6].
